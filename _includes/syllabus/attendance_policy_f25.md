This course will be held in person. You are responsible for completing the work assigned and seeking clarification as needed. Late work is generally not accepted without prior arrangement or proper justification.

- Attendance is required for:
  - Lectures and guest lectures
  - Discussions (absence will incur a penalty)
  - Assigned presentation slots (practice and real)
- For presentation phase, on days you are not presenting:
  - You get 2 unexcused absences, i.e., you will get to be absent without telling the instructors beforehand.
  - For any further absences during presentation phase, you will not get attendance points for that lecture.
  - If you get caught posting questions without being in class, you will get 3 absences worth of penalty.
- In-advance excused absences: 
  - If you have interviews or other pre-existing commitments, can ask for an exceptional absence (up to 2 more), not including medical reasons.

### Grace day policy & scheduling presentations:

- You are allowed one homework grace day that you can use towards **exactly one** of the following assignments:
  - Paper review
  - Literature survey draft
  - Literature survey
  - Capstone report review
  - Capstone final presentation review
- For main presentations only, you are allowed to swap dates with another student **exactly once**. If you chose to swap main presentation slots (e.g., due to a job interview), you and your swapping partner must ***let the instructors know via email at least 3 days in advance*** (otherwise you will get a zero on the presentation assignment).
- There are no grace days for the discussion lectures (and corresponding summaries) or main presentation questions.
