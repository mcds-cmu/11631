***Collaboration policy***: For preparing each presentation and literature survey, you must only share work with your assigned teammates and no other students. Paper summaries, reviews, and capstone reviews are individual assignments. This course is intended to give you experience in autonomous research, so trying to delegate or shortcut preparation is a wasted learning opportunity. Acting against this rule will be considered an academic integrity violation and lead to reprimands, including possible dismissal from the program (see the MCDS Handbook).

***Plagiarism and AIV policy***: The presentation and related work survey emphasize a literature search and compare/contrast to other material. All material you find and use in any of the course deliverables must be explicitly and correctly referenced/cited. Notes:

- Directly copying text from the paper being summarized, and/or from author websites or other sources, without using "quotation marks" around everything that is a direct quote, followed by a reference to the source being quoted, is plagiarism. 
- Text and/or slides copied directly from other sources without attribution in presentations is also considered plagiarism.

Here are some resources for learning what is and isn't plagiarism:

***GenAI use policy***: In this course, you are expected to do all the work that is required to satisfy the learning objectives. Use of generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) to automatically do your assignments for you is not allowed: **any assignment you turn in must be your own writing and content** (i.e., no direct copy-pasting output from GenAI models, and no copy-pasting + manual or automatic paraphrasing). 

You may use GenAI to enhance your understanding of papers and subjects (e.g., by asking questions about papers), helping find papers to include in your literature review (but beware of it may invent non-existent papers), and to ask for feedback on your writing flow (e.g., "can you indicate whether the ordering of paragraphs makes sense"). For grammar and writing improvement, we suggest using [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) instead of GenAI.

It is very ***easy to tell when a student is not actually familiar or has not actually understood the material***. If we suspect or confirm that you turned in something AI generated or relied too heavily on AI for your assignments, we reserve the right to ask you to justify your turned-in assignment, waive all your grades in that homework category, or even report an academic integrity violation (AIV).
