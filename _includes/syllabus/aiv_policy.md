***Collaboration policy***: For preparing each presentation, you share work with your assigned teammates and no other students. In particular, when your paper is also being presented by a different team(s) in the same or different section of this course, you may not collaborate or share work with students in this other team(s). Similarly, all other deliverables in the course are individual assignments. You are required to synthesize, research literature, and produce the document by yourself without working with your classmates. This course is intended to give you experience in autonomous research, so trying to delegate or shortcut preparation is a wasted learning opportunity. Acting against this rule will be considered an academic integrity violation and lead to reprimands, including possible dismissal from the program (see the MCDS Handbook).

For your paper summaries and comparative analyses, you must produce your own work. You may discuss the papers with classmates, but the submissions must be your own work. Do not use the internet or other sources to find prior analyses to complete your assignments.

***Plagiarism and AIV policy***: The presentation and related work survey emphasize a literature search and compare/contrast to other material. All material you find and use in any of the course deliverables must be explicitly and correctly referenced/cited. Notes:

- Directly copying text from the paper being summarized, and/or from author websites or other sources, without using "quotation marks" around everything that is a direct quote, followed by a reference to the source being quoted, is plagiarism. 
- Text and/or slides copied directly from other sources without attribution in presentations is also considered plagiarism.
