The bulk of the course will consist of paper discussion sessions as well as associated presentations and reviews of related works. The deliverables expected from each student are:

1. Play a role in a student team to present an analysis and critique of an assigned paper.
2. Written summaries of the assigned paper when not presenting.
3. Prepared questions and commentaries for the assigned paper to facilitate classroom discussion.
4. Comparative analyses of base papers and surprise papers.
5. A written literature survey on related work.
6. A constructive review of a capstone project.

The course is sectioned into two parts, parts I and II. Part I of the course consists of group presentations and paper discussion sessions in which students are divided into groups to present the assigned reading for that session while other students submit a paper summary for it. Part II of the course consists of three surprise paper sessions, a literature survey assignment, and a capstone project review.

### Part I

_Presentations_
{: .fw-700 }

In the first half of the course, each class session involves reading, presenting, critiquing, and discussing one assigned paper. Before each session, all students are required to read the paper. One team of students are responsible for presenting the paper. Each student in the presenting team is assigned a specialist role (details below) which guides the critiquing approach to the paper. All other students are required to submit a summary of one of the two assigned papers for that week.

The class session begins with a presentation, after which the class breaks into smaller discussion groups. Each presenter is responsible for generating a discussion question, and the class is divided into groups based on these questions for more targeted discussions.

*Discussions:*

Discussion questions come from the people who presented that day. While each role comes up with their own discussion question, please make sure that the questions are different enough.

 Note: please consolidate all the discussion questions (one per role) into one slide that you will keep up at the end of the presentation.

We will break up into groups, one group per discussion question, for about 15minutes / 50% of the time remaining before the end of lecture.

 One member of each discussion group will have to take notes.

Each member will fill out the Audience question form available on Canvas.

 Note: people who presented that day do not have to fill out the form.

Then, we will have a full-class discussion, where one member from each group (note-taker or someone else) will summarize the main talking points that were brought up during the group discussion. (remaining 15 minutes)

*Grace day policy:* Each student is granted **one** grace day throughout Part I of the course. A grace day is a day that you notify us in advance that you will not be presented for the class. This is the day that you **will not be selected to present in a team nor be chosen as one of the reviewers of the presentations**. This grace day is only allowed once. Any additional absence from the course throughout Part I of the course will result in a zero grade should you be randomly selected to present and/or on the additional absence day. 

_Specialist roles_
{: .fw-700 }

Each student in a team is assigned a role to play to critique a paper. Each role is of equal importance. Details and suggested preparations for each role are detailed below. Students are encouraged to read through each role and request clarification if needed. To foster individuality and diverse student backgrounds, students are offered to give their preferences to play each role. However, the ultimate decision of assigning roles belongs to the instructor. It is plausible that students are not assigned their desired roles. If this is the case, students are encouraged to take this opportunity to step outside of their comfort zone and discover their potential. It is noted that not all roles would be assigned for all papers. Roles are assigned to a paper based on its suitability to the context and content of the paper. It is also noted that depending on the number of students in a course session (sessions A and B), one student might present multiple times. If this is the case, the student would be assigned to a different paper, team, and role each time they are presenting.

For more details on the descriptions of each specialist role, please see [Specialist Role Descriptions]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.subpath }}{% link f23/specialist_role_descriptions.md %}).

_Paper summaries_
{: .fw-700 }
	
When a student is not in a presenting group for a given class session, this student must submit a summary of the assigned paper and a discussion question for the presenters regarding the paper, presentation, or individual role. We provide a guided questionnaire for students to complete the paper summary. Our goal is to have deep and collaborative discussions on the week's topics. To do so, it is important that all students are well-prepared for each class. Group presentations are followed by a discussion session monitored by the instructor. To ensure that all students are prepared for the discussions, **the instructor will call on students at random to ask the prepared question, comment on the paper or offer commentary to the presenters**. Although we recognize that this approach may induce some level of stress in students, it is our instructional philosophy that it is alright to offer incorrect answers, uncomfortable with random chance, and afraid of asking silly questions. Only by doing so do you grow. In short, **it's okay not to know; it's not okay not to have tried.**

**ChatGPT red-teaming question:**

*Extra credit: Try asking ChatGPT/other AI platforms some questions related to the paper or its general topic, and assess the output's correctness. Your goal is two-fold: (1) find an input question / prompt that will lead ChatGPT to produce something incorrect, and (2) explain what about the output is incorrect, and hypothesize why ChatGPT might have gotten it wrong.*

*You will get more points the more creative your input prompt/question is, and the better your explanation is for why it got it wrong.*

**Grading rubric:**

*0: if the system got the answer right*

*Prompt points:*
*1: low-hanging fruit input prompt (e.g., who is Author?, explain [paper title], copy-pasted questions from our own assignments)*
*2: good input prompt (summarize this paper, and good explanation (this likely will be the most common grade?)*
*3: input prompt is creative and interesting*

*Explanation points:*
*0: Explanation is missing or wrong*
*1: Explanation is correct*
*2: Explanation is correct and shows insights into limitations of ChatGPT*

### Part II

The second half of the course consists of surprise paper sessions, guest speaker presentations, a literature survey, and a capstone project review.

_Surprise paper sessions and guest speaker presentations_
{: .fw-700 }

The second half of the course starts with three surprise paper sessions in which students are required to read a base paper before the Tuesday class meeting. During the Tuesday class meeting, the instructor will distribute an additional paper to be read. There will also be a presentation from a guest speaker during the class meeting on Tuesday or Thursday. For each of the first two surprise paper sessions, students must submit a comparative analysis to compare and contrast the base and surprise papers due on Tuesday.

For the last surprise paper session, each student chooses one additional paper to write a related work survey of the base, surprise, and additional papers. Students are encouraged to take this opportunity to practice their literature survey skills to prepare for the comprehensive literature survey assignment to be due at the end of the course.

_Literature survey_
{: .fw-700 }

Each student chooses any paper covered in the course for which they will write and submit a detailed literature survey. It is recommended that students start exploring their topic of interest earlier in the semester through the presentation and/or surprise paper sessions to headstart their literature survey process. It is required that each student has the survey document proofread and revised in collaboration with the Global Communications Center before submission for grading.

_Capstone project review_
{: .fw-700 }

Finally, during the last two weeks of class, students will attend at least one final second-year capstone presentation and review one draft capstone report written by a second-year MCDS student team.
