Each student in a team is assigned a role to play to critique a paper. Each role is of equal importance. Details and suggested preparations for each role are detailed below. Students are encouraged to read through each role and request clarification if needed. To foster individuality and diverse student backgrounds, students are offered to give their preferences to play each role. However, the ultimate decision of assigning roles belongs to the instructor. It is plausible that students are not assigned their desired roles. If this is the case, students are encouraged to take this opportunity to step outside of their comfort zone and discover their potential. It is noted that not all roles would be assigned for all papers. Roles are assigned to a paper based on its suitability to the context and content of the paper. It is also noted that depending on the number of students in a course session (sessions A and B), one student may be presented multiple times. If this is the case, the student would be assigned to a different paper, team, and role each time she or he is presenting.
