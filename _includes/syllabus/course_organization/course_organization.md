The bulk of the course will consist of paper discussion sessions as well as associated presentations and reviews of related works. The deliverables expected from each student are:

1. Play a role in a student team to present an analysis and critique of an assigned paper.
2. Written summaries of the assigned paper when not presenting.
3. Prepared questions and commentaries for the assigned paper to facilitate classroom discussion.
4. Comparative analyses of base papers and surprise papers.
5. A written literature survey on related work.
6. A constructive review of a capstone project.

The course is sectioned into two parts, parts I and II. Part I of the course consists of group presentations and paper discussion sessions in which students are divided into groups to present the assigned reading for that session while other students submit a paper summary for it. Part II of the course consists of three surprise paper sessions, a literature survey assignment, and a capstone project review.

### Part I
	
In the first half of the course, each class session involves reading, presenting, critiquing, and discussing one assigned paper. Before each session, all students are required to read the paper. Two teams of students are responsible for presenting the paper. Each student in the presenting team is assigned a specialist role (details below) which guides the critiquing approach to the paper. All other students are required to submit a summary of the assigned paper and a discussion question for the paper and/or the presenting team.

A class session starts with presentations of each team and is followed by a discussion. The discussion is moderated by the instructor and starts by **randomly selecting** students in the class to ask and answer questions and offer their commentary. If time permits, the discussion would then be opened to other students.

{: .fw-700 }
	
When a student is not in a presenting group for a given class session, this student must submit a summary of the assigned paper and a discussion question for the presenters regarding the paper, presentation, or individual role. We provide a guided questionnaire for students to complete the paper summary. Our goal is to have deep and collaborative discussions on the week's topics. To do so, it is important that all students are well-prepared for each class. Group presentations are followed by a discussion session monitored by the instructor. To ensure that all students are prepared for the discussions, the instructor will call on students at random to ask the prepared question, comment on the paper or offer commentary to the presenters. Although we recognize that this approach may induce some level of stress in students, it is our instructional philosophy that it is alright to offer incorrect answers, uncomfortable with random chance, and afraid of asking silly questions. Only by doing so do you grow. In short, **it's okay not to know; it's not okay not to have tried.**

### Part II

The second half of the course consists of surprise paper sessions, guest speaker presentations, a literature survey, and a capstone project review.

_Surprise paper sessions and guest speaker presentations_
{: .fw-700 }

The second half of the course starts with three surprise paper sessions in which students are required to read a base paper before the Tuesday class meeting. During the Tuesday class meeting, the instructor will distribute an additional paper to be read. There will also be a presentation from a guest speaker during the class meeting on Tuesday or Thursday. For each of the first two surprise paper sessions, students must submit a comparative analysis to compare and contrast the base and surprise papers due on Tuesday.

For the last surprise paper session, each student chooses one additional paper to write a related work survey of the base, surprise, and additional papers. Students are encouraged to take this opportunity to practice their literature survey skills to prepare for the comprehensive literature survey assignment to be due at the end of the course.

_Literature survey_
{: .fw-700 }

Each student chooses any paper covered in the course for which she/he will write and submit a detailed literature survey. It is recommended that students start exploring their topic of interest earlier in the semester through the presentation and/or surprise paper sessions to headstart their literature survey process. It is required that each student has the survey document proofread and revised in collaboration with the Global Communications Center before submission for grading.

_Capstone project review_
{: .fw-700 }

Finally, during the last two weeks of class, students will attend at least one final second-year capstone presentation and review one draft capstone report written by a second-year MCDS student team.
