The main objective of the course is to get familiar with critically reading, reviewing, and presenting data science papers, to prepare you for the capstone courses. As such, the course will involve the following activities which each student is expected to participate in:

- Attend lectures (3) and guest lectures (3)
- Read paper according to a specialist role, write a short summary, and discuss it with a group (3)
- Do a practice (1) and main (1) in-class presentation (individual or in pairs) for papers that you have read
- Attend in-class presentations by your colleagues, and ask a question for each presentation
- Write a paper review (1) and a literature survey (2) according to a theme of your choosing
- Write a constructive review of a capstone report (1) and of a capstone presentation (1)

### Presentations

A main goal of the class is to learn how to clearly and effectively present research/papers to others, which is a core component of being a data scientist. There will be two opportunities to present papers in class:

- Practice presentations: Each student will present a paper to a smaller audience over Zoom, and will receive feedback from one of the TAs.
- Main presentations: Each student (individually or in pair) will present a paper to the entire class.

*Presentation length*: There will be 4 presentations per class, which means each presentation must be at most 15 minutes long, with 5 minutes for questions from the audience.

*Audience questions*: During the main presentation phase, those who are not presenting that week must fill out an audience form with a question for each of the papers. The instructor will randomly select a couple of people to ask their question out loud.

*Selection of papers*: For the practice presentations, you will be assigned the paper that you have to present. For the main presentations, we will ask for paper suggestions from all students, and then assign presentation papers taking into account who nominated what paper.

### Summaries and Discussions

Another main goal of the class is to be able to critically read a paper and discuss it with others. There will be a total of three discussion lectures, which will go like this:

- You will be assigned a paper
- You will be assigned a specialist role, which will describe the lens through which you should present the paper
- Before the start of each discussion lecture, you will have to post a summary on Canvas that summarizes your talking points for the discussion.
- After each discussion lecture (or during), you will post a follow up comment on your own summary on Canvas with one thing you learned from the discussion.

*Summary format & length*: you will post the summaries to Canvas, and keep them between 400 and 600 words. Ensure that your summaries are readable to someone who has not read the paper. Avoid huge walls of text, and feel free to use bulleted lists or other formatting. Do not post images, charts, or tables.

The specialist roles are the following:

- Reviewer
- Archaeologist
- Researcher
- Industry Expert
- Social Impact Assessor

### Review & literature survey

Another goal of this class is to prepare you for the capstone classes in the Spring and Fall, in which you will do a capstone research  project of your choice. To prepare you for that project, you will have to work your way up to a literature survey in the topic area of your project, in a group of at most 4 students. This will encompass three steps:

- *Team and topic choice*: you will have to come up with a topic area, 4 relevant papers, and find your teammates.
- *Paper review*: you will each write a review of a paper, focusing on the remaining broad questions that the paper leaves open. Each teammate will get one of the papers you submitted. Write at most 1.5 pages of content. 
- *Draft literature survey*: focusing on your task and topic area, summarize and compare your 4 related papers' similarities and differences, as well as the remaining questions that the papers leave open. Write at most 3 pages, and at least 2 pages (excluding references). 
- *Literature survey*: staying in the same topic area and task, you will choose an additional 4 papers, and discuss them together with the 4 papers from the draft literature survey (8 total) in a literature survey. Write at most 6 pages, and at least 5 pages (excluding references). 

*Format*: LaTex with Bibtex, using the ARR style format ([LaTeX templates](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html), also available as an [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj)).

### Capstone project review

Finally, during the last two weeks of class, students will attend at least one final second-year capstone presentation and review one draft capstone report written by a second-year MCDS student team.

### ChatGPT red-teaming

*Extra credit*: Try asking ChatGPT/other AI platforms some questions related to a paper that someone presented in class, and assess the outputâ€™s correctness. Your goal is two-fold: (1) find an input question / prompt that will lead ChatGPT to produce something incorrect, and (2) explain what about the output is incorrect, and hypothesize why ChatGPT might have gotten it wrong.

*You will get more points the more creative your input prompt/question is, and the better your explanation is for why it got it wrong.*
