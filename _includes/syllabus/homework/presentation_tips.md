Here are some general tips for presenting a research paper, though some of these may not apply to your paper.

### Introduction

- Assume an adversarial crowd - assume they don't care about your project
- Motivate your project by explaining: why it matters, what real-world problem it might solve, etc.
- Reel people in using a captivating example! Simplify your task and walk through an example so people really understand. High level data descriptions don't give the listener a concrete idea of the data we're looking at. Caveat: make sure the example is short; people shouldn't be reading for more than 10-15 seconds.

### Data description

- Include interesting examples if it's data that people are unfamiliar with or if the data has interesting properties
- Include data statistics (with numbers and/or graphs)

### Methodology

- Diagrams, flowcharts, drawings are much better than text! Often it takes a while to come up with a good visualization for your model, but it can create much more lasting impression than 5 equations.
- Keep equations at a minimum (and don't put more than 1 or 2 equations in one slide)
- Also, using animation as you explain your models or algorithmic procedures can help people follow along as you are talking.
- Use intuitive labels or icons.
  - If it's a vector, draw a narrow vertical rectangle
  - Use logos or cliparts for articles, stories, people, etc.

### Experimental Set-Up

- Include what the train/dev/test split is.
- Include what objective function you are optimizing and what metrics you will be evaluating

### Results

- Make visuals (tables and graphs) easy to follow with a clear takeaway message. Audiences should be able to look at tables and draw conclusions without having to interpret them on their own. You can also use bold font to make the best performing models more clear in tables.
- Replace all tables with graphs/other types of visualizations (you will very likely lose points if you screenshot a table from the paper).

- Make sure to title and label tables/axis/legends correctly.
- Limit significant figures! p= 0.35 is much more legible than p = 0.346749362.
- Include short takeaways from results (plots/tables)
- Tell the audience what an ideal plot would look like to help understand the plot

### General tips

- Limit the number of words per slide as much as you can Try writing out what you want to say first, then replace words with graphs/images/icons.
- Rehearse your talk fully at least once, it helps debug structural and technical issues and helps you figure out how you're doing on the time limit. This is especially helpful if you're co-presenting
- Make sure you look up at the audience and not your slides (especially if those are behind you). Using speaker notes is fine but make sure you're not reading them out loud.
- If you're pointing at something in the slide, try to highlight it either using a laser pointer or using animations (fade, red circles, etc).
- Content warning: if you're tackling a problem space that contains sensitive topics, offensive language, etc. please use a content warning, and refrain from using actual examples (e.g., use emojis or blurred out text instead). ***Refrain from using slurs*** out loud or in your slides (e.g., f*g, f*ggot, n***er, b*tch, n*gga, etc). Remember to keep your audience's well being in mind.


### FAQ from practice presentations
**Q:** *The [assigned] paper for the practice presentation is in total 42 pages long. Do we have to study the entire 42 pages for the presentation?*
<br>**A:** Thank you for asking. Although the article is 42 pages long, the **main text** is only around 10 pages. The remainder consists of references and an appendix, which you should only consult if necessary.

**Q:** *Wanted to confirm if the 15 minutes of practice presentation includes the 5 minutes for questions? (because I see in the Excel file for the paper assignments that there is no separate 5 minutes slot for questions)*
<br>**A:** The practice presentation must be 13-15 minutes with no questions from the audience, so that we can get through all slots!

**Q:** *I was wondering - what should the title slide look like? What information should it include in addition to the name of the paper?*
<br>**A:** The first slide can include details such as the title of the paper, your name, the date of the presentation, and other relevant information if any. It is also in general a good practice to add the authors' names in the title slide to give due credit. If there are too many authors, just the first author's surname followed by "et al." is also okay. If there is space left, you can also mention the venue, but it's not necessary. Further, affiliation logos are a good idea. Since you are from LTI, the LTI and CMU logos in one corner are often considered the normal.

**Q:** *I know that we were told to recreate the graphs and not use the graphs directly from the papers but some of the graphs are hard to recreate and quite important to be included in the slides. Can it be an exception if we site it properly?*
<br>**A:** Yes, you can use such plots, as long as it is explicitly mentioned in the slide and duly cited. 

**Q**: *Wanted to check if we are allowed to use Microsoft Designer Tool (will it be considered AIV)? I believe the tool might be AI powered. It will not generate content, but will help create slide designs.*
<br>**A**: If it is based on your content, and the image/art generated is reasonably general (for example, a timeline image based on your text that included a timeline), it should be okay. However, if you ask it to generate a very specific image (say, something similar to what DallE or other diffusion models would generate), then I would refrain from doing so. It is important to evaluate how much novelty the designer is really adding to the image before using it. Furthermore, you should consider the need for the designer altogether, as it often creates very unnecessarily flashy and marketing-y looking designs which may actually distract from the content rather than enhance it. 

**Q**: *Do I need to cite the formulas from the paper when I use them? Is it okay to take a screenshot of the formula and include it in my slide like the one below? For some reason, it is clearer than the ones I typed out using latex myself.*
<br>**A**: For equations, you do not have to cite the paper if you're screenshotting the equation. However, equations can be quite dry and boring and overwhelming to look at, so it's hard to make them interesting in a slide... if you just copy-paste the equation but do nothing with it, it could fall under "wall of text" issues (esp. cause the variables need to be defined)... but if they have good animations, colors for different variables, etc., then that's fine. So for equations it's more about "is the equation easily understandable", and often making them easily understandable requires some level of animation.

**Q**: *I was wondering if there was a need to cite any icons we might get from free websites.*
<br>**A**: That depends on the licence under which the icons are made public. If they are free for use, then no. Else, it depends on the licence requirements and those should be followed properly.

**Q**: *I was wondering if it is required to cite images not from academic sources. For example, I include an apple picture I find from Google, do I include the source?*
<br>**A**: Yes, you should ideally cite that image. Even better would be to check the licence under which it is available. If it can be freely used without a citation, then it's okay not to cite it. If not, then a citation would be necessary. At the very least, include the link to the image at the bottom of the slide in a small font text box.

**Q**: *How should we go about citing data that we use to recreate the paper's figures?*
<br>**A**: If you use numbers from somewhere, just put a citation at the bottom of the slide. Else, if it is an image that you use as a sub-part of the figure that you are creating, then just put a link to the image if taken from the internet (unless available for free use), or the citation of the source from where it is taken from.

**Q**: *I am using Canva to draw a flowchart that I personally think will be beneficial for explaining. If I use the template and mention it in my slides, will it be considered AIV?*
<br>**A**: That won't be AIV. Just be very explicit!
