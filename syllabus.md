# Syllabus

## Course Learning Outcomes

The main learning objectives of the course are for students to (a) demonstrate a basic understanding of the Data Science literature (via sample application areas, associated publication venues, and writing styles), (b) apply this understanding to specific publications (by writing and justifying academic evaluations of the work), (c) report on a Data Science publication in a comprehensive, collaborative presentation of a given publication and its related works, (d) defend and criticize, via relevant statements, questions and form-based evaluation, reports, and presentations on Data Science publications while participating in constructive discussion about such presentations, and (e) able to critically analyze and synthesize Data Science literature individually from the lens of a specialist role and collaboratively in a group.

All of these outcomes are essential preparation for the subsequent MCDS capstone course sequence (11-634 Capstone Planning Seminar, 11-632 Data Science Capstone, and 11-635 Data Science Capstone Research). 

## Time & Location

Tuesday-Thursday: 5-6:20PM

TEP 1403

## Course Format

In-Person. The course opens with an initial overview of the Data Science literature and tutorials on how to analyze and critique Data Science publications. The course also provides tutorials on preparing and presenting reviews of Data Science publications and related literature.

## Course Organization

The main objective of the course is to get familiar with critically reading, reviewing, and presenting data science papers, to prepare you for the capstone courses. As such, the course will involve the following activities which each student is expected to participate in:

- Attend lectures (3) and guest lectures (3)
- Read paper according to a specialist role, write a short summary, and discuss it with a group (3)
- Do a practice (1) and main (1) in-class presentation (individual or in pairs) for papers that you have read
- Attend in-class presentations by your colleagues, and ask a question for each presentation
- Write a paper review (1) and a literature survey (2) according to a theme of your choosing
- Write a constructive review of a capstone report (1) and of a capstone presentation (1)

### Presentations

A main goal of the class is to learn how to clearly and effectively present research/papers to others, which is a core component of being a data scientist. There will be two opportunities to present papers in class:

- Practice presentations: Each student will present a paper to a smaller audience over Zoom, and will receive feedback from one of the TAs.
- Main presentations: Each student (individually or in pair) will present a paper to the entire class.

*Presentation length*: There will be 4 presentations per class, which means each presentation must be at most 15 minutes long, with 5 minutes for questions from the audience.

*Audience questions*: During the main presentation phase, those who are not presenting that week must fill out an audience form with a question for each of the papers. The instructor will randomly select a couple of people to ask their question out loud.

*Selection of papers*: For the practice presentations, you will be assigned the paper that you have to present. For the main presentations, we will ask for paper suggestions from all students, and then assign presentation papers taking into account who nominated what paper.

*Presentation format and visuals*: Please refer to this guide for tips on how to present your paper: {% include syllabus/course_organization/presentation_tips.md %}

### Summaries and Discussions

Another main goal of the class is to be able to critically read a paper and discuss it with others. There will be a total of three discussion lectures, which will go like this:

- You will be assigned a paper
- You will be assigned a specialist role, which will describe the lens through which you should present the paper
- Before the start of each discussion lecture, you will have to post a summary on Canvas that summarizes your talking points for the discussion.
- After each discussion lecture (or during), you will post a follow up comment on your own summary on Canvas with one thing you learned from the discussion.

*Summary format & length*: you will post the summaries to Canvas, and keep them between 400 and 600 words. Ensure that your summaries are readable to someone who has not read the paper. Avoid huge walls of text, and feel free to use bulleted lists or other formatting. Do not post images, charts, or tables.

The specialist roles are the following:

- Reviewer
- Archaeologist
- Researcher
- Industry Expert
- Social Impact Assessor

See the following link for descriptions on what each role should do: {% include syllabus/course_organization/specialist_roles.md %}

### Review & literature survey

Another goal of this class is to prepare you for the capstone classes in the Spring and Fall, in which you will do a capstone research  project of your choice. To prepare you for that project, you will have to work your way up to a literature survey in the topic area of your project, in a group of at most 4 students. This will encompass three steps:

- *Team and topic choice*: you will have to come up with a topic area, 4 relevant papers, and find your teammates.
- *Paper review*: you will each write a review of a paper, focusing on the remaining broad questions that the paper leaves open. Each teammate will get one of the papers you submitted. Write at most 1.5 pages of content. 
- *Draft literature survey*: focusing on your task and topic area, summarize and compare your 4 related papers' similarities and differences, as well as the remaining questions that the papers leave open. Write at most 3 pages, and at least 2 pages (excluding references). 
- *Literature survey*: staying in the same topic area and task, you will choose an additional 4 papers, and discuss them together with the 4 papers from the draft literature survey (8 total) in a literature survey. Write at most 6 pages, and at least 5 pages (excluding references). 

*Format*: LaTex with Bibtex, using the ARR style format ([LaTeX templates](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html), also available as an [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj)).

All assignments from this sequence can be found here: Full assignment: {% include syllabus/homework/literature_review.md %}

### Capstone project review

Finally, during the last two weeks of class, students will attend at least one final second-year capstone presentation and review one draft capstone report written by a second-year MCDS student team.

### ChatGPT red-teaming

*Extra credit*: Try asking ChatGPT/other AI platforms some questions related to a paper that someone presented in class, and assess the outputâ€™s correctness. Your goal is two-fold: (1) find an input question / prompt that will lead ChatGPT to produce something incorrect, and (2) explain what about the output is incorrect, and hypothesize why ChatGPT might have gotten it wrong.

*You will get more points the more creative your input prompt/question is, and the better your explanation is for why it got it wrong.*

## Attendance and Grace Day Policy

This course will be held in person. You are responsible for completing the work assigned and seeking clarification as needed. Late work is generally not accepted without prior arrangement or proper justification.

- Attendance is required for:
  - Lectures
  - Discussions (absence will incur a penalty)
  - Assigned presentation slots (practice and real)
- For presentation phase, on days you are not presenting:
  - You get 2 unexcused absences, i.e., you will get to be absent without telling the instructors beforehand.
  - For any further absences during presentation phase, you will not get attendance points for that lecture.
  - If you get caught posting questions without being in class, you will get 3 absences worth of penalty.
- In-advance excused absences: 
  - If you have interviews or other pre-existing commitments, can ask for an exceptional absence (up to 2 more), not including medical reasons.
- You can get extra credit for attending all guest lectures.

### Grace day policy & scheduling presentations:

- You are allowed one homework grace day that you can use towards **exactly one** of the following assignments:
  - Paper review
  - Literature survey draft
  - Literature survey
  - Capstone report review
  - Capstone final presentation review
- For main presentations only, you are allowed to swap dates with another student **exactly once**. If you chose to swap main presentation slots (e.g., due to a job interview), you and your swapping partner must ***let the instructors know via email at least 3 days in advance*** (otherwise you will get a zero on the presentation assignment).
- There are no grace days for the discussion lectures (and corresponding summaries) or main presentation questions.

## AIV and Plagiarism Policy

***Collaboration policy***: For preparing each presentation, you share work with your assigned teammates and no other students. In particular, when your paper is also being presented by a different team(s) in the same or different section of this course, you may not collaborate or share work with students in this other team(s). Similarly, all other deliverables in the course are individual assignments. You are required to synthesize, research literature, and produce the document by yourself without working with your classmates. This course is intended to give you experience in autonomous research, so trying to delegate or shortcut preparation is a wasted learning opportunity. Acting against this rule will be considered an academic integrity violation and lead to reprimands, including possible dismissal from the program (see the MCDS Handbook).

For your paper summaries and comparative analyses, you must produce your own work. You may discuss the papers with classmates, but the submissions must be your own work. Do not use the internet or other sources to find prior analyses to complete your assignments.

***Plagiarism and AIV policy***: The presentation and related work survey emphasize a literature search and compare/contrast to other material. All material you find and use in any of the course deliverables must be explicitly and correctly referenced/cited. Notes:

- Directly copying text from the paper being summarized, and/or from author websites or other sources, without using "quotation marks" around everything that is a direct quote, followed by a reference to the source being quoted, is plagiarism. 
- Text and/or slides copied directly from other sources without attribution in presentations is also considered plagiarism.

Here are some resources for learning what is and isn't plagiarism:

## Specialist roles

Each student in a team is assigned an equally important role to discuss and critique a paper. Details and preparations for each role are provided below. Students should review these and ask for clarification if needed. While students can express role preferences to reflect their individuality and backgrounds, the instructor makes the final decision. Students may not always get their preferred roles but are encouraged to use this as a chance to explore new abilities. Due to class size, not all students will play every role.

### Reviewer

Complete a full critical but not necessarily a negative review of the paper. Follow the guidelines for writing the paper review ({% include syllabus/homework/literature_review.md %}). Write between 400 and 600 words.

### Archaeologist

The aim of this role is to show the originality and relevance of your research with respect to past and future methodology. Determine where this paper sits in the context of previous and subsequent work. Concretely, you must find and report on one prior paper that substantially influenced the current paper and one newer paper that cites this current paper. Briefly summarize each of these papers and their relationship to the current paper. Write between 400 and 600 words.

1. **Identify Influential Prior Work:**
   - Find a previous paper that substantially influenced the current paper. Summarize its key contributions and explain how it relates to and sets the foundation for the current research.
2. **Locate Subsequent Citations:**
   - Identify a newer paper that cites the current paper. Summarize this newer work and describe how it builds upon or diverges from the current research.
3. **Contextualize the Research:**
   - Place the current paper within the broader research landscape by comparing and contrasting it with the identified prior and subsequent works. Discuss its originality and relevance in advancing the field.
4. **Write a Comprehensive Summary:**
   - In 400 to 600 words, synthesize the summaries and analyses of the prior and subsequent papers, detailing their relationship to the current paper and its position within the ongoing research conversation.

### Researcher

The aim of this role is to propose an imaginary follow-up project â€“ not just based on the current but only possible due to the existence and success of the current paper. You must write the proposal with the following components:

- Motivation/introduction/problem statement: why is the proposed project important? Why is the general task or area important?
- Background: what do we already know in the field? What has been tried? What have we learned so far?
- Method and design: what is your proposed approach? How will you set up your experiments ? How will you evaluate success?
- Significance and conclusion: what would the results tell us, if your project was successful? What doors would that open for other researchers or practitioners?
- References: make sure to cite papers that you mention.

Write between 400 and 600 words.

### Industry Expert

You must discuss how the method discussed in the paper can apply to one real-world scenario and propose a new application. Put yourself in the shoes of an employee proposing this application to their boss. Establish context (such as the industry you are working in, current solution and resources, etc.) and discuss the use-case, road map, and business advantage of utilizing the method for your application.

1. **Identify the Problem:**
   - Describe a problem that can be solved using the paper.
   - Propose a realistic solution based on the paper.
2. **Establish Context:**
   - Describe your employer's context, including: industry relevance, current solution, available resources and funding, company data, business goals and objectives.
   - Make reasonable assumptions if data is unavailable.
3. **Detail the Steps and Roadmap:**
   - Outline background work before implementation.
   - Specify data and resource requirements.
   - Plan steps for complete solution implementation.
4. **Discuss the Impact:**
   - Argue why your solution is a worthwhile investment.
   - Highlight advantages and superiority over the current solution.
   - Discuss potential disadvantages, drawbacks, and costs.

Write between 400 and 600 words.

### Social Impact Assessor

The Social Impact Assessor evaluates the potential societal implications of the paper's findings and methodologies. This role involves analyzing how the research might affect various communities, considering both positive and negative consequences. The assessor examines ethical considerations, potential biases, and the broader societal context. By providing a critical perspective on the social ramifications, the assessor ensures that the discussion includes an understanding of the research's impact beyond the technical aspects.

1. **Identify Stakeholders:**
   - Determine who will be affected by the research outcomes, including communities, industries, and specific demographic groups.
2. **Analyze Positive and Negative Impacts:**
   - Evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of the research on society, considering aspects such as privacy, equality, and access.
3. **Examine Ethical Considerations:**
   - Assess the ethical implications of the research methods and findings, identifying any biases or ethical concerns.
4. **Provide Recommendations:**
   - Suggest ways to mitigate negative impacts and enhance positive outcomes, ensuring the research promotes social good and minimizes harm.

Write between 400 and 600 words.
